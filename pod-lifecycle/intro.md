# k8s pod lifecycle

This scenario aims for getting a better understanding of:

- pod lifecycle [WIP]
- container status [tbd]
- sidecar pattern [tbd]

And telling you how to verify k8s document.

## overview

tbd..

## what I learned

- Don't use sidecar if you don't have to
- phase, status, conditions are different things
